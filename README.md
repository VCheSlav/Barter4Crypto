# Barter4Crypto
Barter Goods and Services for cryptocurrency world wide.

Technical & Community Roadmap
Our development team is made up of volunteers donating their time and energy to execute this roadmap. 

Goals:
Phase 1:
Choose which coins will be bartered for  services and goods.
Run nodes with core wallets.
Build  Platform for users to create  wallets with coin of choice.
Secure wallets.
Build trading platform for listings of goods and services.

Phase 2:
Combine wallets with trading platform.
Build status bar for trading platform.
Build verification bar for services rendered or goods bartered. (coins will transfer immediately and confirm but withdrawl will be disabled until  order is complete to avoid fraud) Once service is complete or goods are received the status bar will be complete and withdraw for that order will be available.
Build automatic pay out to  external address for users. (avoid holding coins in wallets to avoid getting hacked and becoming a target)

Phase 3:
Build mobile  app


We are looking for Devs with VM experience, running a node, and securing cryptocurrency wallets.
